Understanding where agricultural nutrients originate in the landscape can help mitigate downstream transport by selecting and installing best management practices that target nutrient sources. We collected flow and water quality data from 2017–2021 at two similar HUC-12 watersheds in northeastern Indiana, which provided an opportunity to link nutrient sources with transport processes in intensively managed agricultural watersheds. We calculated metrics to represent changes in nutrients during a storm event, including hysteresis (the change in concentration on the rising limb of the hydrograph compared to the recession limb) and the flushing index (the difference between concentrations at peak discharge and baseflow). We compared storm-based and annualized concentration-discharge (C-Q) relationships for NO3-N, soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), total P (TP), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to land use and climate variables. Together, these provide insight into nutrient storage zones and transport pathways at the small watershed scale. Our results suggest these landscapes have plentiful and widely distributed sources of nitrogen (N) that are activated in the spring, which we observed as chemostatic behavior (i.e., concentration remained relatively constant during different flows). While this has been shown at larger scales in agricultural watersheds, these patterns are challenging to parse at the small watershed scale. We saw concentrating effects (i.e., increased concentrations as flow increased) for DOC, TP, and SRP during storms, suggesting activation of flow-paths connecting land-based sources to receiving streams. We also noted faster travel times in the winter for all four constituents when subsurface tile drains are most active and plant uptake is negligible. Our results differentiate nutrient delivery mechanisms and can aid management decisions by identifying environmental factors that most influence transport and selecting conservation practices that target these nutrient pathways.            </p>
