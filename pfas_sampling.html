            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
				Per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), commonly referred to as “forever chemicals”, are chemical compounds resistant to breakdown, containing complex, hydrophobic molecular structures. 
				Perfluoroalkyl substances are found in products such as heat-resistant cookware and aqueous film-forming foam used to extinguish jet fuel fires. Because these compounds resist degradation, they can persist in the environment for decades. 
				Only 24 states have implemented regulations for PFAS in drinking water. However, Arkansas has not adopted any such limits. With few regulations and observations available, the concentrations, fate, and transport remain uncertain, leading to issues and uncertainties in quantifying PFAS contamination. 
				PFAS compounds are amphiphilic, with a hydrophilic head and a hydrophobic tail. Because of these properties, PFAS compounds can concentrate at air-water interfaces in the environment. Traditional surface water sampling is conducted in the middle of the water column; thus, these sampling methods might lead to underestimations of surface water concentrations. 
				We collected weekly grab samples of two stream locations (upstream and downstream of Northwest Arkansas National Airport) at the water surface and at 1/2 - 2/3 depth in Spring 2025. 13 of 30 targeted PFAS were detected in one or more water samples. We used a linear mixed model to identify the effects of sampling methods on PFAS concentrations. 
				Statistically significant main effects of sampling type (surface vs. middle) were detected for 4 of 13 compounds, with concentrations in the surface being 11 – 123% higher. Enrichment factors for these 13 compounds ranged from <1 to over 8.6. 
					81% of PFOS samples collected at the surface exceeded the EPA’s MCL of 4 ppt, compared to 31% of samples collected in the middle of the water column. These results provide implications for characterizing PFAS contamination in streams. 	 </p>

                <li>13 out of 30 targeted PFASs were detected above LOD in one or more water samples. </li>
                <li>PFAS concentrations were 2-123% higher in surface samples, which can influence whether a water body exceeds the EPA’s MCL for that compound. </li>
                <li>Concentrations collected at the surface were statistically significant for 4/13 (PFOS, FTS, PFNA, PFPeS) compounds (11 – 123%) .</li>
				<li>7/13 PFAS compounds were statistically different between our two sites. 3/7 compounds were higher in the upstream site and were associated with compounds traditionally used in AFFF</li>
