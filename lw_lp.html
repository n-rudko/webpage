             Agricultural production in the US has led to harmful environmental consequences; excess nutrients leaving the Midwest have worsened the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico. Many studies have assessed the effectiveness of conservation practices at the field scale, yet studies quantifying their impact at the watershed scale proves difficult and is often met with mixed results. We compared water quality data collected from 2009 – 2015 and 2021 – 2024 for two small watersheds in Indiana. Conservation practices, such as cover crops, nutrient management plans, and structural practices were implemented beginning in 2013, providing the opportunity to assess the long-term effectiveness of conservation practices on NO3-N concentrations. Adoption rates of cover crops were estimated to be as high as 43% in the treatment watershed. We compared in-stream NO3-N concentration for three time periods, baseline (2009 – 2012), post-implementation I (2013 – 2015) and post-implementation II (2021 – 2024). We also compared these results with those of citizen science efforts that have sampled at least 6 streams within these watersheds twice a year for over 10 years. We detected statistically significant reductions of NO3-N (27%) in the treatment watershed relative to the control in the Post I monitoring period. Post I and Post II concentrations were not significantly different. Concentrations for streams collected in the control and treatment watershed collected in a citizen science program highlight that concentrations at the treatment watershed have been consistently lower than the control watershed between the Post I and Post II monitoring periods. This suggests that farmers did not abandon practices after their implementation, and that practices have been effective in maintaining the achieved lower concentrations during the first post implementation monitoring that occurred 10 years ago. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of community outreach, citizen science, and joint efforts by researchers, watershed coordinators, and landowners to improve water quality. Future studies should consider conducting water quality monitoring several years after implementation of conservation practices to determine their long-term effectiveness, and to identify if practices have been abandoned by farmers.
